- pip (get it together, install that package manager)

### Steps 👇

1. Clone the repo like a boss:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-inflator.git
   ```

2. Bounce into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-inflator
   ```

## Usage 🕶️

### Command-Line Vibes 🚀

Wanna make your image *huge*? Here’s how:

```bash
python inflator.py --input <path-to-your-image> --output <path-to-save-enlarged-image> --scale <scale-factor>
```

Example:
```bash
python inflator.py --input input_image.jpg --output enlarged_image.jpg --scale 2
```
This will take `input_image.jpg`, blow it up like it’s on *steroids*, and save it as `enlarged_image.jpg`. ⚡

### GUI for the Chill People 🖥️

Not into the terminal life? No worries, just run the GUI version:
```bash
python gui.py
```
A window will pop up and you can drag, drop, and scale away like a pro. 🔥👑
